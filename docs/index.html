    <h1>DataFed Source Documentation</h1>

    <p>DataFed is a federated data <i>collaboration</i> and <i>management</i> system for science. DataFed provides many features that ease the <i>data management burden</i> associated with general scientific research; however, the primary goal of DataFed is to <i>improve scientific data quality</i> by enabling precise full-life-cycle control over data artifacts, with the ability to uniformly share and access data across geographically distributed facilities. The combined capabilities of DataFed directly support the concept of <i>"repeatable science"</i> by unambiguously identifying data, capturing context and metadata, and by providing the means to access and utilize data globally.</p>

    <p>This site is a work-in-progress but will eventually server as the main index into the public source-level documentation for DataFed. Presently, only the Python client package documentaion is available.</p>
